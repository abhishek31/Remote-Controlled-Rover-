The Remote-Controlled Rover was developed as a final-year undergraduate project to create a compact, Wi-Fi-enabled mobile surveillance robot capable of streaming live video and detecting unauthorized personnel. Built using a Raspberry Pi, DC and servo motors, and an onboard camera mounted on a 3-DOF arm, the robot transmitted real-time video to a remote-control center. The video feed was processed in MATLAB using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for face recognition. If an unrecognized face was detected, the system triggered an onboard alarm, making it suitable for restricted-area monitoring and security applications.

The project integrated hardware and software components including L293D motor drivers, Python for motion control, mjpg-streamer for video transmission, and Raspbian Wheezy OS. The rover was constructed with a lightweight chassis and compact design, prioritizing efficiency, low power consumption, and functional mobility. The system achieved over 90% face recognition accuracy on a custom dataset and demonstrated the potential for real-time, AI-assisted surveillance in cost-sensitive environments.
